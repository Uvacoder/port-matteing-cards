If you're ever struggling with a horizontal CSS overflow, a good way to check what's going on is to add a bright red CSS border to every item on the page.

Here's a snippet that will help you achieve this:

```css
* {
	outline: 1px solid #f00 !important;
}
```

This also helps with all kinds of other styling and positioning problems. Happy designing!
