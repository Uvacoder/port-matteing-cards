Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for a blast from the past. When this website was created, "Hey There Delilah" was a staple of every Serious™️ YouTube video.

Somehow ⎯ I really can't explain this ⎯ my first website from 2010 is still live on the web. I was 10 years old when I created this. To this day, it looks exactly as how I left it.

This is insane. [You can visit it here.](https://whataforums.webs.com)

## The Dream

> My journey into the world of making began at an early age. When I was in elementary school, I somehow stumbled upon the site Webs.com, where I began making small mini-sites and forums. At the time, my (ridiculous!) goal was to create a “Facebook killer” called MyAllSocial and I remember getting excited when every new user joined… I got like 10 users in total. All in all, pretty weird times, but it was the humble start of something awesome.

As a child, my dream was to create a Facebook killer. I'd spend all my days finding ways to make that happen: from learning how to code by myself, to carefully and frequently updating my Webs.com site.

It wasn't exactly successful at that! I remember wildly celebrating every single _individual_ user that would sign up. At the time, I remember it being a huge deal. I managed to convince someone to use something I made!

That last point was particularly important. I struggled to be taken seriously throughout my childhood, both from family and outsiders. **I was creating things that were tangible, things that the other kids couldn't do.** Hell, I was creating things **people 2x my age then** couldn't do!

I was building businesses at 12 years old and those around me didn't understand it. Nobody nurtured it, I just pressed on with the naiveté of a child.

I do understand it, to be honest.

## The Many Rebrands & Spin-offs

I built many now-defunct sites. Some I probably don't even remember, there's only tiny trails left behind around on random Internet forums about SEO and design.

Some names I've gone with:

-   MyAllSocial
-   Visiopia Forums
-   TechnicaBit Forums
-   Alphasquare (whole separate project, actually!)
-   Zeam
-   Funcrunch
-   Hexus
-   Mxious

## All The Forums

I was raised by the Internet. I'd spend all my time in online forums, particularly:

-   SnedekerDesignz ⎯ I used to hang out there... that's where I got introduced to my lifelong passion, front-end engineering.
-   Twii.me ⎯ small community by Anthony Rossbach where I spent most of my childhood
-   Probably some other sketch SEO and web-dev forums

## The Great Free Struggle

A big hurdle I faced constantly was not having money to buy stuff I wanted online. This greatly limited my options when developing sites.

There was zero way in hell I'd get my parents to pull out the Visa to get me a domain name. Oh, and I was 12!

However, I flourished due to the **gigantic** amount of free site hosts that were available back then. Without free site hosting sites, I can say this with confidence: my SWE career would've never began.

Things that were a serious hustle at the time:

-   Not having a domain name... nobody took me seriously!
-   Free hosts would shut down, so I'd be moving from host-to-host constantly
-   000webhost suuuuuucked
-   If you could find a cPanel and unlimited free host, holy shit, you were golden. Looking at you, SixServe and x10hosting!
-   dot.tk domains were absolute ass and spam-ridden
-   co.cc, 'nuff said
-   Hitting the limits of my free Webs.com plan and not being able to do anything about it
-   Setting up Postfix ⎯ yikes!
-   Offering myself as a content writer in exchange for a VPS to play with (honestly one of the best things I've ever done)
-   Playing around with 128mb RAM free VPS sites (like vps.me)
-   Setting up PHP, Apache2 and MySQL on random VPSs that could barely run it
-   Using nginx or lighttpd because my free VPS would _die_ with Apache
-   Setting up Ajenti because I thought it looked so sick
-   Trying out CMS like WordPress and social scripts like Oxwall
-   All those times I used "nulled" or "cracked" forum themes for MyBB
-   All those times I used "nulled" versions of... everything, lol.

The biggest jump for my career was growing up and getting my first Visa debit card.
