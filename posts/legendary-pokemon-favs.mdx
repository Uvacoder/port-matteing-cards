I recently saw this _inspiring_ thread on one of my favorite Twitter accounts...

<Tweet tweetId="1575206671474753536" alt="Okay, okay. Hear me out." />

I immediately began wondering. What are my favorite legendary Pokémon?

## Giratina

	/>
</div>

Admire this badassery.

My fondest Pokémon memories are sitting in my couch, face up, messing for hours and hours with Platinum. I remember catching this one deep in a cave in the earlier Diamond game, but Platinum expanded the gameplay significantly with a new "Distortion World" where Giratina resides.

Giratina's origin story of violence was terrifying to me. It always seemed like a powerful one, full of resentment yet compassion for the human spirit.

> Giratina was said to be banished for its supposedly violent behavior, though in the anime, it is shown to possess a gentle side as well.

> Giratina at one point carried a grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it, though years later, it would become a protector of the world. Due to its violent nature, history on Giratina was covered due to ancient people fearing it. Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. The anime reveals Giratina can also open portals though anything that reflects. Giratina's role is to keep both worlds in balance. Giratina also had many different titles to it; banished Pokémon, Arceus's shadow, the Pokémon of Shadows, and being on the other side of our world.

## Dialga and Palkia

    <Figure className="aspect-square p-6" alt="Palkia">
    	<Image src="/pokemon/palkia.png" objectFit="contain" />
    </Figure>

</div>

This is the holy duo. Dialgia & Palkia are some of my most cherished legendaries. I'll always remember the tune of Mt. Coronet as I fearlessly ventured through it in search of Spear Pillar.

## OST Highlights

On another nostalgic note, I'm a gigantic fan of [insaneintherain's]() remakes of the Gen 4 OST. Here are some highlights.
