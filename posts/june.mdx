The past few months I've been contracting full-stack engineering work for [June.so](https://june.so), a YC-backed startup.

-   Built a beautiful iOS widget (learned along the way!)
-   Built static-site infrastructure for their API docs, from the ground up

This was a blast. Working with the June team was a breeze and I learned quite a bit from the in-house design folks as well.

I'm enjoying my early 20s. I'll explore [the world at my own pace](https://google.com), thank you very much.

```elixir
defprotocol Utility do
  @spec type(t) :: String.t()
  def type(value)
end

defimpl Utility, for: BitString do
  def type(_value), do: "string"
end

defimpl Utility, for: Integer do
  def type(_value), do: "integer"
end
```

In a way, this feels like the rebound from years of pressures and insecurities. Pressures about what to do during my early 20s. Expectations about what I should become. A disillusionment with the bullshit-peddling machine that is hustle culture.

-   [ ] to do
-   [x] done

I'm making things at my own pace. I'm not pressuring myself to build anything. It'll get finished when it gets finished.

It feels good to do whatever you want. It's liberating, refreshing and the best way to reboot the soul.
